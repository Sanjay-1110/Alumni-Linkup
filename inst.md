- Implement notifications (real-time or email-based) based on available time.
- Perform thorough testing and finalize documentation for the project demo.

## 10. Potential Challenges and Solutions
- **Real-Time Messaging:**  
  - *Challenge:* In-memory channels may lose messages on server restart.  
  - *Solution:* Persist critical chat data in the database for demo reliability.
- **Payment Integration:**  
  - *Challenge:* Handling live transactions can be complex and error-prone.  
  - *Solution:* Rely on Razorpay’s test mode and simulate transactions for demonstration.
- **User Role Management:**  
  - *Challenge:* Differentiating access and functionalities for multiple roles within one user model.  
  - *Solution:* Clearly define role-based permissions and use conditional UI rendering.
- **Notification System:**  
  - *Challenge:* Implementing fully real-time notifications may add complexity.  
  - *Solution:* Begin with basic pull-based or email notifications, with the possibility to extend to real-time if time permits.

## 11. Future Expansion Possibilities
